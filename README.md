This script is basically used for **monitoring and managing IPv6 tunnels**.

Its main purpose is:

1. **Show tunnel status**

   * You can see which tunnel is active (`active`) and which is down (`down`).

2. **Gather address information**

   * Local and remote IPv4 addresses for each tunnel
   * The IPv6 range assigned to each tunnel

3. **Provide a clean, graphical overview**

   * Color-coded table with ✔ and ✖ for quick status recognition
   * Gives a summary of all tunnels in one glance

So if you have tunnels like:

* `6to4-tunell`
* `grev6-tunell`
* `ipipv6-tunell`

This script gives you **a quick, organized view of the status and addresses of each tunnel** without having to manually check each one.

In short: **a tool to see which IPv6 tunnels are up and what their addresses are**.
